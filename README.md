# Technigo Bootcamp - Project 1 - News Site

Creating a responsive news site about a topic of our choice. 
 Criteria to have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.


## The problem

Had issues making the website responsive and making the cards align properly.

Hade issues with time management and found myself getting stuck in the chair for hours.
